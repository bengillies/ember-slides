Ember-Slides
============

Another slideshow app. This time written in Ember.js.

See the demo folder for an example and instructions on how to use it (it's intentionally simple).

Run the demo with

```
$ cd demo && python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

And then open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.
