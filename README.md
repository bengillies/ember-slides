Ember-Slides
============

A(nother) slideshow app. This time written in Ember.js.

See the demo folder for an example and instructions on how to use it (it's intentionally simple). For a "real-life" use case, see http://bengillies.net/talks/ember-parallel/#/slides/1, which I gave as as talk at the London Ember.js meetup in January.

Run the demo with

```
$ cd demo && python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

And then open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.
