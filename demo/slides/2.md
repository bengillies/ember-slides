Getting Started
===============

To start, you'll need to grab all the JS dependencies:

- Ember.js
- Handlebars
- jQuery
- Marked.js
- Ember-Slides

And optionally the CSS files:

- Bootstrap-large
- Ember-Slides.css

Stubbing out an html page
-------------------------

As this is an Ember app, you don't need much of an HTML page. The following is the HTML page for this demo presentation (don't worry about the JS bit):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Ember-Slides Demo</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap-large.min.css">
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/ember-slides.css">
	</head>
	<body>
		<script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
		<script src="handlebars-v1.1.2.js"></script>
		<script src="ember.min.js"></script>
		<script src="marked.js"></script>
		<script src="../js/ember-slides.js"></script>
		<script>
			App.slides = [1, 2, 3, 4];
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

The slides
----------

Next, create a `slides` folder, and start filling it with you slides.

Slides are written in Markdown format one per file, so slide `1.md` might contain the following:

```markdown
First slide
===========

This is my first slide
```

Controls
--------

That's pretty much it. When you're done, open HTML page. You should get an index page from where you can navigate to the first page.

To advance slides, use the right arrow. To go back, use the left arrow. To get back to the index, use the up arrow.
