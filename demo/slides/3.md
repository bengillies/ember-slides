Live Code eval
==============

Being written in Ember does have some advantages.

If you declare a code block with the type javascript, the code inside will automatically eval for you when you load the slide.

If you declare a code block with the type handlebars, you'll get a button underneath it to render the template. Use these together to run code:

	```handlebars
	{{#view App.TestView}}
		{{view.foo}}
	{{/view}}
	```
	
	```javascript
	App.TestView = Em.View.extend({
		foo: "I'm using eval and there's nothing you can do about it."
	});
	```

renders as following:

```handlebars
{{#view App.TestView}}
	{{view.foo}}
{{/view}}
```

```javascript
App.TestView = Em.View.extend({
	foo: "I'm using eval and there's nothing you can do about it."
});
```

Slide Order
-----------

Finally, you need to declare your slides and the order you want them in. You see on the [previous slide](#/slides/2) what that looks like, but basically, put something at the bottom of you HTML file that looks liek this:

```html
<script>
	App.slides = [1, 2, 3, 4];
</script>
```

Running Locally
---------------

If you need to run you slideshow locally, you can do so using the following command from the directory your index.html file is in:

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

and opening http://localhost:8000/
